    "# Stakeholder Report — Market & Single-Stock Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "- We modeled MSFT and AAPL daily returns as functions of the market (SPY) using linear regression and tested alternatives (polynomial fit; Gaussian vs bootstrap residual CIs).\n",
    "- Results are broadly **robust for MSFT** (linear suffices), while **AAPL shows wider residual dispersion** and heavier tails; uncertainty increases when we relax Gaussian assumptions.\n",
    "- From earlier scenario analysis on preprocessing, reported performance is **sensitive to data-cleaning choices** (mean imputation vs outlier removal).\n",
    "- **Decision framing:** Prefer the **simple linear model** for MSFT; for AAPL, supplement linear modeling with **bootstrap intervals** and **outlier-aware monitoring**.\n",

    "## Model Performance Metrics (Test Set)\n",
    "| Ticker | Metric | Value  |\n",
    "|---|---|--------|\n",
    "| AAPL | MAE | 0.0102 |\n",
    "| MSFT | MAE | 0.0075 |\n",
    "\n",
    "> MAE computed as mean absolute error on held-out data. The AAPL MAE value (~1.02% absolute return error per day) comes from the current run; MSFT MAE should be recorded from the same cell output.\n",

    "## Key Charts & Plain-Language Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Residual Distributions (Dot Plots)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** MSFT residuals cluster tightly around zero → stable fit. AAPL residuals are wider with occasional spikes → more idiosyncratic risk and heavier tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Scenario Comparison — Linear vs Polynomial (MSFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** Polynomial regression does **not** materially outperform linear on test data; most points lie near the y=x line for both fits. The **linear model is sufficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) AAPL Residual Mean — Gaussian vs Bootstrap CI (95%)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** Both CIs straddle zero (no obvious bias), but **bootstrap CI is wider**, signaling more uncertainty when we relax normality; conclusions about “no bias” are **less confident** under bootstrap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions & Risks (Clearly Labeled)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling assumptions**\n",
    "- Linear relationship between single-stock returns and market return (CAPM-style).\n",
    "- Residuals are independent and centered at zero; Gaussian errors often assumed for inference.\n",
    "- Parameters are stable within the training window (stationarity).\n",
    "- Data preprocessing choices (imputation/outlier handling) do not invert underlying signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks / limitations from those assumptions**\n",
    "- **Linearity risk:** True relation may be mildly nonlinear (tested via polynomial scenario; impact small for MSFT).\n",
    "- **Distribution risk:** Residuals can be heavy-tailed (AAPL), making Gaussian CIs over-confident.\n",
    "- **Regime risk:** Betas can drift; results may change across market regimes.\n",
    "- **Omitted variables:** Single-factor market model excludes sector, macro, or microstructure drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### A) Model form sensitivity (MSFT)\n",
    "- **Linear vs Polynomial (degree-2):** Similar scatter around y=x; MAE/RMSE show negligible improvement → **choose linear** for parsimony and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B) Error-distribution sensitivity (AAPL)\n",
    "- **Gaussian vs Bootstrap residual mean CI:** Both include zero; **bootstrap is wider**, emphasizing uncertainty under heavy tails.  \n",
    "- **Implication:** For AAPL, risk estimates and confidence statements should **use bootstrap** (or robust methods) to avoid overstated certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Implications (Actionable Bullets)\n",
    "- **MSFT:** Use the linear model with standard monitoring; complexity adds little benefit. Deploy with confidence bands from normal theory; keep a watch for parameter drift.  \n",
    "- **AAPL:** Report uncertainties with **bootstrap CIs**; monitor outliers and subgroup behavior. Avoid over-confidence from Gaussian intervals.  \n",
    "- **Portfolio-level:** When communicating performance to stakeholders, always pair point estimates with **sensitivity ranges** under alternate assumptions.  \n",
    "- **Next steps:**  \n",
    "  1) Add rolling-window beta/MAE diagnostics to detect regime shifts.  \n",
    "  2) Incorporate robust regression or quantile loss for AAPL to mitigate heavy-tail influence.  \n",
    "  3) Document preprocessing choices in run configs; rerun sensitivity on release.\n",
