# Deliverables README

## Audience
Portfolio managers and business stakeholders who need a clear, decision-oriented view of single-stock risk/return behavior and model robustness.

## What’s Included
- `final_report.md` — Stakeholder-ready write-up with executive summary, charts + takeaways, assumptions/risks, and sensitivity analysis (alternate scenarios).  
- `images/` — All exported figures used in the report (residual dot plots, linear vs polynomial, Gaussian vs bootstrap, and Stage12 charts).  

## Why This Format Fits
- **Plain language + key charts** enable quick understanding without technical overhead.  
- **Sensitivity sections** make assumption risk explicit, improving decision confidence.  
- Markdown is **portable and version-controlled**, easy to diff, and convertible to PDF/Slides when needed.

## Repo Placement Guidance
- Place this folder under `/deliverables/` in your repo (`bootcamp_haotian_zhuo`).  
- Keep raw/processed data in `data/` per Stage 5, and preprocessing utilities per Stage 6.  
- Notebook(s) that generated the figures should live under `/homework` or `/project` subfolders with clear run instructions.
